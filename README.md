## My Primary Responsibilties

* Created, maintained and managed PostgreSql database using SQL and schemas using C#

* Created subscription functionality and email templates for full application integration with Mailchimp
* Created all Redux actions and reducers for several components to send data from the application to the store
* Created sign up and login functionality, sending data from the application to the database and store

## Personal Challenges

1. Integrating Mailchimp
2. Working with token based authentication for signup and login

## Solution

1. Researched and read documentation to understand Mailchimp integration. Finding as many resources as possible to create subscriptions and email templates.
2. Research using token based authentication for signup and login using React and Redux.

## Success

Project managed through agile project management with the use of SCRUM and Kanban boards. Held daily standups to discuss daily accomplishments, plans, and blockers. Used git to collaboratively store code and interact with other developers. Created well-thought out-weekly sprints to accomplish all goals and plan for time management. 

## What I would do differently

It is key to take into account possible barriers that may arise. Also, understanding that resources for solutions are not always readily available so there are times needed for deep research.
